I am a youth sociologist at the Tampere University in Finland. In my PhD-thesis, I focus on the social marginalisation of young adults not in education or employment. I am particularly interested in studying social emotions such as shame and loneliness from a sociological perspective.

This is my personal website (also available [in Finnish](/fi/)). Please find my publications below (see also my [university profile page](https://www.tuni.fi/en/vesa-valimaki), [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8537-9686) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZaKXCGkAAAAJ)).
